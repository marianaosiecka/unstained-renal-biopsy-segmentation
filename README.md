# unstained-renal-biopsy-segmentation
This code is part of experimental research that applies state-of-the-art segmentation models and machine learning techniques to segment unstained renal biopsy samples.

There are two segmentation approaches in this repository, a **shallow approach** using machine learning techniques such as **K-NN** and **K-Means**, and a **deep-learning** approach using **SAM**, **SAM2**, and **U-Net**.

For further instructions on how to execute our code access the corresponding READMEs.
